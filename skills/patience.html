Patience is the ability to remain calm when dealing with a difficult or trying task, situation, or person.

Patience is a prominent theme in religion, and many of us have grown up being told that “patience is a virtue.” In short, it is the level of endurance you have before getting frustrated.

Being a steadfast and patient person isn’t always easy, especially in the face of the pressure and challenges put upon us in modern society.

Yet being able to persevere, tolerate delay, and respond to stressful situations without annoyance or anger are all incredibly valuable and noble personality traits.

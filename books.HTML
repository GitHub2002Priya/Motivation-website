<p>Eckhart Tolle is a German born writer.Other books by Tolle include Guardiansof Being, Oneness With All Life: Inspirational Selections from A New Earth, Practicing 
the Power of Now: Essential Teachings,Meditations, and Exercises from The Power of Now and A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose.Eckhart Tolle was born in 
Lunen, Germany in 1948. Tolle says that he suffered from depression for most of his life until he underwent an inner transformation at the age of 29. He then spent 
years traveling and in spiritual contemplation. He then settled in North America and began writing his first book, The Power of Now. It became a bestseller and 
remains one of the most popular books on spirituality.</p>

<p>The Power Of Now: A Guide To Spiritual Enlightenment teaches readers the bliss of being present in the current moment.</p>

<u>Summary of The Book:</u>

<p><u>The Power Of Now:</u> A Guide To Spiritual Enlightenment is a self-help book with a difference. It does not promise riches and dreams coming true through the power
of the mind. Instead, it sets out to show the reader how to silence the mind and realize their true identity.The author explains that people have been conditioned 
by lifelong habits to confuse their mind with their identity. They think that it is the mind and thoughts that define who they are. However, Tolle points out that 
if they just relax and take the time to look inwards, they will be able to observe their thoughts objectively.
This book shows that there is an identity beyond the mind, a state of being in which silence reigns, where the clatter and chatter of the mind can be ignored.
This state is achieved through practice. It just involves the person being present in the moment and observing life and everything around them.
Many people are unhappy with present situations, and worried about current relationships. Either they look forward to a change in the future or spend time worrying
that what is good in their lives might be lost. The Power Of Now: A Guide To Spiritual Enlightenment says that instead, the person should accept their situation,
good or bad, and acknowledge its right to exist.
This passive acceptance frees the tension and resistance in thoughts about current circumstances. This state of being is most conducive to allow the person to think 
calmly about a problem and find a solution. Apart form this, being present in the moment also makes the person calm and more aware of life. It frees them from past 
regrets and future worries. The only reality is the present moment. Embracing it and being fully present in it will ultimately help the person go beyond their mind 
and reconnect with who they really are.</p>

“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” — Marcus Aurelius

We are stuck, stymied, frustrated. But it needn’t be this way. There is a formula for success that’s been followed by the icons of history—from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs—a formula that let them turn obstacles into opportunities. Faced with impossible situations, they found the astounding triumphs we all seek.

These men and women were not exceptionally brilliant, lucky, or gifted. Their success came from timeless philosophical principles laid down by a Roman emperor who struggled to articulate a method for excellence in any and all situations.

This book reveals that formula for the first time—and shows us how we can turn our own adversity into advantage.

Think and Grow Rich has been called the "Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature." It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself.The most famous of all teachers of success spent "a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort" to produce the "Law of Success" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers.
